"Single source of truth"
  Define a value in one place

Model is controller agnostic

'getValue' should be 'isValue' for booleans

Model can provide the frame in a callback
  Callbacks are functions; they take parameters, they return values

debugger;
  keyword to set a breakpoint in the very code itself


Variable names
  Don't use 1 letter variable names
  Be descriptive/precise

dispatch table
  A data structure
  Check it out
  Better than long chain of if statements or switch table

gameEntity not really productive, since controller treats snakes and fruits separately

MattsValidator("[number, number]", positionArray)
  Try using something like this for data validation, rather than writing out every test for data type

check out exceptions
